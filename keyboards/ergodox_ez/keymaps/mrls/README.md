This is my personal keyboard layout. I'm in the constant process of modifying
it to fit my personal needs. At the moment these needs are: 

1. being able to type as fast as I do in a qwerty layout
2. use the keyboards configurability to come up with layouts that fit with the
   tools I use and the way I work

If you want to see the current layouts, please open the `keymap.txt` file. You
can also click on the version number to see a version at the ergodox-ez
website.

Changes
-------

[V7](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/vljvpx/edit):

* Switch from Linux to Mac friendly
* Introduce single hand typing layer

[V6](http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/qjpwbd/edit):

- Introduce the Backspace key at the top right position, like in qwerty. Since
  I'm still constantly looking for it there.
- Shift all the number keys in the right side of the keyboard to start from the
  first key to free the Backspace key. This is a bit of a stretch for number 7
  but I'm not too worried about that since I don't use the numbers that often,
  however this could be a problem with the ampersand and star symbols.
